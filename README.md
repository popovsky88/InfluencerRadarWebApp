# InfluencerRadarWebApp

In this project, we aim to help marketing employees quickly access the basic information of influencer on the social platform. We develop a web application that integrates account information from Instagram Graph API. And we build our application based on AWS Amplify, AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB service, which provides a tidy interaction interface.

To use our services, users simply need to type in the ID of an interested account and press the search button, then a detailed account analysis report will be returned.
