# InfluencerRadarWebApp

In this project, we aim to help marketing employees quickly access the basic information of influencer on the social platform. We develop a web application that integrates account in- formation from Instagram Graph API. And we build our application based on AWS Amplify, AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB service, which provides a tidy interaction interface.

To use our services, userssimply need to type in the ID of an interested account and press the search button, then a detailed account analysis report will be returned as shown in Figure 3. They can also get some inspirations from our recommended influencer accounts in certain areas by clicking on correponding buttons floating below the search box, see Figure 4
